# Next Trucking Company ML Project

## About NEXT Trucking
As one of California’s fastest growing FreightTech companies, NEXT is on a mission to make freight
painless. Through complete first-to-last mile solutions, we’re defining how FreightTech can transform
the $800B trucking and shipping industry. From our digital freight marketplace to smart load-matching,
our technology provides shippers with access to limitless capacity and full transparency, while
empowering drivers to work the way they want, when they want.

## Goal of This Project
NEXT Trucking is interested in better understanding the drivers in its network. The ultimate goal is to
both build a predictive model capable of determining overall network capacity to handle incoming
shipping requests as well as more effectively recruit high-performing drivers to enhance their network.
As a first step, they are interested in developing a classification model to better determine whether or
not a driver will be a high-performing one.

## Overview of the Process
1. Generated new labels
2. Created a data feature extraction plan and implemented a pipeline to execute it
3. Implemented Principle Component Analysis
4. Employed an ensemble method
5. Applied different ML algorithms like SVM, NN and LR 
6. Cross-Validated my training results
